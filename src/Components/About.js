        Hi! I’m Jack Reacher, and I’m a developer who has passion for building clean web applications with intuitive
        functionalities. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into reality using creative solutions. I’m always
        curious about
        learning new skills, tools, and concepts. In addition to working on various solo full stack projects, I have
        worked with
        creative teams, which involves daily stand-ups and communications, source control, and project management.
